================

To be able to create a new build, install node.js and run the following commands:

`npm install -g grunt`

`npm install grunt-contrib-less grunt-contrib-copy grunt-contrib-clean grunt-contrib-compress grunt-contrib-sass`

After that you can open the console and just type `grunt` to create a new build in the "dist" folder.

If you want to create a zipfile containing the current build, run `grunt pack`.
