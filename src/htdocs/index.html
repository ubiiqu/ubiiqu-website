					<p>In terms of digital services, we're the first to admit that each company is created differently, requiring services custom-tailored to their size, user base and spread. ubiiqu analyzes each client's potential and derives the appropriate web strategies to encourage growth. Whether enhancing visual identities, improving functionality or opening up to new channels such as mobile, web or console applications, we focus on forging a multi-pronged approach through our hybrid combination of technology, business and creative consulting.</p>

					<h2><img src="assets/images/ic_start_a_arrow_white.png" class="a-img" />your product, our vision</h2>
					<p>Once we understand what needs to be done, we then focus on how we can implement it. We select the appropriate digital building materials, from software architecture to design mock-ups, and go about modeling the systems, channels and devices that comprise a comprehensive web strategy. From wireframe models, software prototyping and business development, this is the stage where we engage our well-rounded team of designers, developers, copywriters and marketing professionals to conceive the most encompassing of solutions.</p>

					<p>From hundreds of thousands of keystrokes to the many hours spent programming quality code, the minds at ubiiqu put in some very physical effort into realizing our “virtual" services. We love a thorough challenge and embrace the latest technologies to push the limits of our abilities even further. This is where true invention happens. It’s where we forge our own answers and where we redefine the possibilities of what you’ve previously thought possible. It all culminates in our rigorous prototyping, testing and quality control phase, which ensures truly revolutionary services for our clients the moment our solutions hit the market.</p>

						<h2>Vision Development</h2>
						<p>
							Seeing is believing, but understanding what you see is certainly of a higher order. ubiiqu's vision developer Philipp Boué brings his multilingual talents to the forefront, speaking not only German, English and some Spanish, but also fluent in the programming languages that allow him to articulate projects with 20/20 vision. His hybrid approach splices together technical savvy with creative consulting, resulting in services that go far beyond that which meets the eye.
							With a Masters in International Business Administration—and certainly the emphasis is on international—Philipp's had stints between London, Munich, Melbourne and Düsseldorf performing an array of consultancy and project management positions for clients including Deutsche Bahn, ZEIT Verlag, Ralph Lauren or Vodafone. When he's not forging peerless visual profiles, you might find him DJing drum and bass, trying his hand at music production or rooting tirelessly for Borussia Dortmund with colleague and fellow fan Manuel.

						<h1>Manuel</h1>
						<h2>Technical Affairs</h2>
						<p>
							The talented Mr. Bieh began his engagement with the internet at the ripe age of 14 when he set up his first commercial website. He has since laid the technical foundations for a wide variety of web pages, software applications and mobile services during his time. With demonstrated programming skills in HTML5, PHP, SQL, CSS3 and an especially strong sense of JavaScript, Manuel takes the nitty gritty syntax of digital coding and transforms it into clean, elegant code. Having serviced a variety of clients while working as a technical officer and software developer, he was even selected in 2008 to pen the first book in Germany about mobile web design.
							As ubiiqu's head of technical affairs, Manuel not only programs with proficiency, but he seeks to connect all that he codes into an “internet of things". What’s that? Well, mobile applications may be the first step, but soon the most mundane of objects will be linked together. This might be the world of tomorrow - he's got it going today.

						<h1>Igor</h1>
						<h2>Operations</h2>
						<p>
							Certainly one of the few people who can boast a discography just as impressive as their CV, Igor splits his time between New York and Berlin promoting a wide range of projects from celebrity marketing tools, digital media applications and the occasional album or two. He signed his first major record deal in 1997 and went on to produce for Sony, Universal and Bertelsmann, which gave him the impetus to fuse his love of music with the emerging possibilities of the mobile market. Since then he's peppered MGM, Fox Mobile and White Diamonds with business development strategies that have helped blossom the profiles of their products and services.
							As head of operations for ubiiqu, Igor injects his background in art into a management style that's equal parts competent and creative. Whether researching new mobile revenue models, establishing streaming services or simply hanging out with fellow musicians and “open-minded business freaks" like himself, he's to be found on the fast track creating the next applications of the brave new digital world.
